<h1 class="about">10: Toronto Raptors </h1>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/36/Toronto_Raptors_logo.svg/1200px-Toronto_Raptors_logo.svg.png" class="boxshadowsss circle">

		<li>2018-19 record: 58-24</li>
		<li>2020 title odds: 50-1</li>
	</ul>
<p class="info">The Raptors didn't have long to celebrate their stunning run to the franchise's first title, thanks to Kawhi Leonard's decision to leave his throne as King of the North to take up residence at Staples Center with the LA Clippers. Still, though the Raptors don't have a championship ceiling anymore, they have a good enough roster -- built around emerging young forward Pascal Siakam, the winner of this season's Most Improved Player award -- to remain a factor in the East. The Raptors do have several large expiring contracts belonging to Kyle Lowry, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka that they could flip at the deadline for assets -- or they could go into next summer with oodles of cap space to chase players who can remake their roster. Don't expect anyone north of the border to be upset, though. They'll be spending the season deservedly celebrating their hard-won title. </p>

<h1 class="about">9: Utah Jazz </h1>

			<li>2020 title odds: 14-1</li>
		</ul>
<p class="info">The Jazz might be equally as good offensively and defensively, which would make Utah a bona fide contender. Poor shooting prevented the Jazz from making their playoff series against the Rockets competitive, as Utah went 26-of-110 (23.6%) on wide-open 3s, as defined by NBA.com as no defender within 6 feet. That won't be a problem after they traded for Mike Conley and signed Bojan Bogdanovic, who should take pressure off Donovan Mitchell to create offense and open up the floor when the young star guard has the ball in his hands. It's up to Rudy Gobert, the two-time Defensive Player of the Year, to make sure the Jazz remain elite on that end of the floor.</p>

<h1 class="about">8: Portland Trail Blazers </h1>

			<li>2018-19 record: 53-29</li>
			<li>2020 title odds: 25-1</li>
		</ul>
<p class="info">The Trail Blazers lightly reshuffled their rotation, with a few critical role players moving elsewhere. The Blazers have the core elements back, but any progression this season will come in two main ways: 1) Jusuf Nurkic getting healthy and returning to form, and 2) Hassan Whiteside fitting in and adding rim protection plus a significant new wrinkle to the pick-and-roll game.</p>

<h1 class="about">7: Boston Celtics </h1>
	<img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-0f122/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/399/18373/1__79929.1463743356.jpg?c=2&imbypass=on" class="boxshadowsss circle">
		<ul class="info">
			<li>2018-19 record: 49-33</li>
			<li>2020 title odds: 25-1</li>
		</ul>
<p class="info">Nothing went the way it was supposed to last season for the Celtics, who entered the season as the favorites to top the East -- only to be drummed out of the playoffs in five games (including four straight losses) by the Bucks. The already bitter taste in the mouths of Celtics fans was made worse after Kyrie Irving and Al Horford chose to leave for Brooklyn and Philadelphia, respectively, in free agency. Irving was replaced by All-Star Kemba Walker, which some might see as an upgrade. It will be much more difficult to make up for losing Horford. Enes Kanter will likely be Boston's starting center, with second-year big man Robert Williams III, Frenchman Vincent Poirier and German Daniel Theis behind him. They will give Boston a few ways to play, but not nearly at the same level of skill and poise that Horford, one of the league's most versatile bigs, did. That, in turn, puts a ceiling on just how good Boston can be -- regardless of how much growth the Celtics get from young wings Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.</p>

<h1 class="about">6: Los Angeles Lakers </h1>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Los_Angeles_Lakers_logo.svg/1200px-Los_Angeles_Lakers_logo.svg.png" class="boxshadowsss circle">

			<li>2018-19 record: 37-45</li>
			<li>2020 title odds: 3-1</li>
		</ul>
<p class="info">A chaotic offseason started with Magic Johnson resigning and putting Rob Pelinka on blast as well as a coaching search that saw negotiations with Ty Lue fall apart before the Lakers hired Frank Vogel. But once the chaos settled, the Lakers landed their highly coveted second superstar and another franchise superstar big man to build around for the foreseeable future in Anthony Davis. Pelinka paid a heavy price in having to send out Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart, three first-round picks, a pick swap and cash to acquire Davis and create as much cap space as possible. They then waited and failed to persuade Kawhi Leonard to come, but acted quickly in free agency by surrounding LeBron James and Davis with several experienced veterans. The Lakers believe they have addressed their mistake from a year ago by adding shooters like Danny Green, Quinn Cook, Jared Dudley and Troy Daniels. They believe they have 3-and-D guys with the additions of Green, Avery Bradley and the re-signed Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. And they added size with DeMarcus Cousins and re-signed JaVale McGee while also bolstering their backcourt depth and bringing Alex Caruso back. This is a roster built to contend for a championship, and anything short of a deep playoff run will be a disappointment.</p>

<h1 class="about">5: Houston Rockets </h1>

			<li>2018-19 record: 53-29</li>
			<li>2020 title odds: 8-1</li>
		</ul>
<p class="info">The Rockets rolled the dice by reuniting Russell Westbrook with James Harden, particularly considering the hefty price of the lightly protected 2024 and 2026 first-round picks they sent to Oklahoma City along with Chris Paul. "It's risky for sure, but I believe the upside is greater than with CP," a team source said. Westbrook's ball dominance and poor 3-point shooting present fit concerns, but Harden pushed hard for the trade, which the Rockets hope will allow them to be legitimate contenders through The Beard's prime, and their window was closing because of the 34-year-old Paul's physical decline.</p>

<h1 class="about">4: Philadelphia 76ers </h1>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Philadelphia_76ers_logo.svg/1200px-Philadelphia_76ers_logo.svg.png" class="boxshadowsss circle">

			<li>2018-19 record: 51-31</li>
			<li>2020 title odds: 8-1</li>
		</ul>
<p class="info">After coming within four bounces of beating the Raptors, falling with a devastating loss at the buzzer in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, the 76ers went out and made some dramatic moves this summer: re-signing Tobias Harris to a five-year, $180 million deal; executing a sign-and-trade with the Miami Heat, sending Jimmy Butler there in exchange for Josh Richardson; and signing Al Horford away from the Boston Celtics with a four-year, $113 million contract. Now, thanks to Leonard leaving Toronto and the rest of the East contenders either standing still or taking a step backward, Philadelphia seems to be the favorite to emerge from the East and reach the NBA Finals for the first time since Allen Iverson led the Sixers there in 2001.</p>

<h1 class="about">3: Los Angeles Clippers </h1>
	<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcStqTp6hLa-dgxoErLNkfTwrcrdcs1AKjK_leW5Ub6zzSoAEoJ-Iw" class="boxshadowsss circle">
		<ul class="info">
			<li>2018-19 record: 48-34</li>
			<li>2020 title odds: 4-1</li>
		</ul>
<p class="info">After a year of rumors of quietly recruiting Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers landed the mysterious forward after what might have been the most intrigue-filled week in free agency in recent memory. Shocking the Lakers, the Raptors and the entire NBA, the Clippers persuaded Leonard to become a Clipper by stealthily working a trade for Paul George. Though the blockbuster move cost a historic haul of five first-round picks, two first-round-pick swaps and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari, the Clippers are now instant title contenders. Leonard and George should fit in seamlessly with a gritty supporting cast and budding Clipper culture built on a low-ego, team-first mentality. Doc Rivers' defense could be the nastiest in the NBA with Leonard, George and Patrick Beverley forming a perimeter wall. Rivers has the best second-unit combo in Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, and role players such as JaMychal Green, Maurice Harkless and Landry Shamet might make the Clippers the best team in not just Staples Center this season but perhaps in the entire league.</p>

<h1 class="about">2: Denver Nuggets </h1>

		</ul>
<p class="info">While the rest of the NBA world went wild, the Nuggets made a few moves along the edges but quietly had one of the best summers of anyone. Adding Jerami Grant is one of the most underrated moves of the offseason, and they effectively are adding 2018 No. 14 overall pick Michael Porter Jr., who sat out the entire season with back issues. Assuming progression from their young rising stars, the Nuggets are firmly a favorite in the West.</p>

<h1 class="about">1: Milwaukee Bucks </h1>
	<img src="https://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images/team_logos/328x328/milwaukee_bucks.png" class="boxshadowsss circle">
		<ul class="info">
			<li>2018-19 record: 60-22</li>
			<li>2020 title odds: 9-2</li>
		</ul>
<p class="info">While the fabric of the Eastern Conference has changed drastically in recent weeks, the Bucks' core has stayed largely the same. The team re-signed starters Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez as well as key reserve George Hill. What set the team apart last season was its deep bench. Will the acquisitions of Robin Lopez and Wesley Matthews be enough to make up for the departures of Malcolm Brogdon, Tony Snell and Nikola Mirotic? A strong bench to support Giannis Antetokounmpo is essential for Milwaukee to make it out of the East finals.</p>
